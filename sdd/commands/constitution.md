# SDD Constitution Command

Create or update project constitution with guiding principles and quality standards.

## What to do:

1. **Parse user input** for principles, guidelines, and quality standards
2. **Read existing constitution** if available at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
3. **Create comprehensive constitution** with these sections:
   - **Project Principles** - Core development values
   - **Quality Standards** - Code quality, testing, documentation
   - **Technical Guidelines** - Framework choices, patterns, conventions
   - **Performance Requirements** - Response times, scalability, limits
   - **Security Standards** - Authentication, data protection, validation
   - **User Experience Principles** - Design consistency, accessibility
   - **Development Workflow** - Git process, review requirements
   - **Deployment Guidelines** - Environments, release process

4. **Ensure directory structure**: Create `.specify/memory/` if it doesn't exist
5. **Write constitution.md** with formatted markdown sections
6. **Reference existing standards** if user mentions specific frameworks or methodologies

## Output Format:
```markdown
