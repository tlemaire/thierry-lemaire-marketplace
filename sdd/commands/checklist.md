# SDD Checklist Command

Generate comprehensive quality checklists for requirements, UX, performance, and accessibility.

## What to do:

1. **Parse checklist type** from user input:
   - `requirements` - Functional requirements validation
   - `ux` - User experience and design consistency
   - `performance` - Performance and scalability testing
   - `accessibility` - Accessibility compliance (a11y)
   - `all` - Generate all checklist types

2. **Find current specification** by looking for:
   - Most recent `specs/XXX-feature-name/spec.md` file
   - Or specification file in current working directory

3. **Create checklist directory**: `specs/XXX-feature-name/checklists/`
4. **Read project constitution** from `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for quality standards

5. **Generate specific checklists** based on type:

### Requirements Checklist (`requirements.md`):
```markdown

```

## Special Feature: `all` Type
When user requests `/sdd.checklist all`, generate all four checklists and create:
```markdown
# Quality Assurance Summary

## Checklist Overview
- Requirements: [X/10] complete
- UX: [Y/15] complete
- Performance: [Z/12] complete
- Accessibility: [A/16] complete

## Critical Issues
[List any blocking issues]

## Recommendations
[Overall quality recommendations]
```

## Customization:
- **Project Constitution**: Incorporate specific quality standards
- **Feature Type**: Tailor checklists to feature complexity
- **Tech Stack**: Adjust items based on technologies used

## Git Integration:
- Commit all checklist files to feature branch
- Use descriptive commit message for quality gates

## Output:
- Show checklist file locations
- Display completion percentages if applicable
- Recommend next command: `/sdd.analyze` for consistency check

Focus on creating actionable, measurable quality gates that can be validated during development and testing phases.
