### 🔄 Iterative Development Best Practices

#### Before Starting Evolution:
1. **Stabilize Current Version**: Ensure existing application is fully functional
2. **Backup Everything**: Create database backups and code branches
3. **Document Current State**: Understand existing architecture before modifying
4. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Define exactly what the evolution includes and excludes

#### During Evolution:
1. **Work in Isolation**: Use feature branches to isolate changes
2. **Test Integration**: Continuously test with existing functionality
3. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for regressions in existing features
4. **Document Decisions**: Keep track of why changes are being made

#### After Evolution:
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test both new and existing functionality
2. **Performance Validation**: Ensure no performance regressions
3. **User Acceptance**: Get feedback from actual users
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Consider feature flags or gradual deployment

### ⚠️ Risk Management for Evolution

#### Identify Potential Risks:
