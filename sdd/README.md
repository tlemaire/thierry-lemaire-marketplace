# SDD - Spec-Driven Development

Transform ideas into structured specifications and executable code through a systematic workflow optimized for Claude Code.

## What is SDD?

**SDD (Spec-Driven Development)** is a systematic methodology that transforms ideas into structured specifications and executable code through a standardized workflow. Fully compliant with GitHub Spec Kit principles, SDD enhances the specification-driven approach with improved memory management and usability features.

### Core Philosophy
- **Specification First**: Define WHAT and WHY before HOW
- **Iterative Development**: Every change follows the same structured workflow
- **Quality by Design**: Built-in checklists and consistency analysis
- **Traceability**: Direct links from requirements to implementation
- **Anti-Abstraction**: Use frameworks directly without unnecessary layers
- **Enhanced Memory**: Transparent, distributed context management for teams

## Why Use SDD?

**For Individual Developers:**
- 🎯 **Clarity**: Eliminate scope creep and ambiguous requirements
- ⚡ **Speed**: Automated task generation and environment setup
- 🔧 **Consistency**: Standardized approach across all projects
- 📈 **Quality**: Built-in QA processes and best practices

**For Teams:**
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: Shared understanding through clear specifications
- 📋 **Traceability**: Track features from idea to deployment
- 🔄 **Onboarding**: Easy for new members to understand project structure
- 📊 **Visibility**: Clear progress tracking and documentation

**For Enterprise:**
- 🏛️ **Governance**: Consistent methodology across projects
- 🔒 **Quality Assurance**: Built-in checklists and validation
- 📈 **Scalability**: Methodology scales from simple to complex projects
- 💰 **Efficiency**: Reduced rework and miscommunication

## GitHub Spec Kit Compliance

✅ **Fully Compliant** with GitHub Spec Kit principles and methodology.

### Compliance Overview
- **Workflow Alignment**: 100% adherence to Spec Kit's specification-driven development process
- **Executable Specifications**: Rich, detailed specifications that drive implementation
- **Quality Gates**: Enhanced validation and consistency analysis
- **Intent-Driven Development**: Clear separation of requirements from implementation

### Key Differences & Enhancements
- **Command Naming**: `/sdd.*` instead of `/speckit.*` (enhanced usability)
- **Memory Management**: Distributed file-based approach vs `.specify/memory/` directory
- **Additional Commands**: Clarify, Checklist, Analyze, and Help for enhanced workflow
- **Progressive Samples**: Complexity-organized learning examples

> **Note**: These differences enhance the Spec Kit experience while maintaining full compliance with core principles. For detailed compliance analysis, see [SPEC_KIT_COMPLIANCE.md](../SPEC_KIT_COMPLIANCE.md).

## Enhanced Memory Approach

SDD implements a superior memory management system compared to traditional `.specify/memory/` approaches.

### What is "Memory" in Spec-Driven Development?
Memory refers to **persistent context storage** that maintains project knowledge, decisions, and patterns across development sessions. It ensures consistency and enables the AI to learn from previous work.

### SDD's Distributed Memory System

#### 🏛️ **Project Memory** (Constitution)
```
CONSTITUTION.md              # Project principles and standards
docs/constitution.md         # Alternative documentation location
.claude/constitution.md      # Claude-specific configuration
```

#### 📋 **Feature Memory** (Specifications)
```
specs/XXX-feature-name/
├── spec.md              # Feature requirements and user stories
├── plan.md              # Technical decisions and architecture
├── tasks.md             # Implementation roadmap and dependencies
├── research.md          # Technical research and findings
└── data-model.md        # Data architecture and schemas
```

#### ✅ **Quality Memory** (Checklists)
```
specs/XXX-feature-name/checklists/
├── code-review.md       # Review standards and criteria
├── testing.md          # Testing requirements and coverage
├── documentation.md    # Documentation standards and templates
└── security.md         # Security practices and validation
```

### Advantages Over Traditional Memory

| Traditional (.specify/memory/) | SDD Enhanced Memory |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| ❌ Hidden directory structure | ✅ Visible, discoverable files |
| ❌ Single large memory file | ✅ Distributed by feature/type |
| ❌ Hard to version control | ✅ Git-friendly, trackable changes |
| ❌ AI-centric format | ✅ Human-readable markdown |
| ❌ Limited scalability | ✅ Grows with project complexity |

### Memory Persistence Benefits

1. **🔍 Discoverability**: All project knowledge is visible and searchable
2. **👥 Team Collaboration**: Memory files work seamlessly with version control
3. **📈 Scalability**: Organized structure grows cleanly with project size
4. **🔄 Continuity**: Context preserved across sessions and team members
5. **📚 Learning**: Accumulated knowledge becomes project documentation
6. **🛠️ Maintainability**: Easy to update and evolve memory over time

## How to Use SDD

### The SDD Workflow

SDD follows a systematic 8-step workflow that transforms ideas into production-ready code:

1. **🏛️ Constitution** - Define project principles and quality standards
2. **📋 Specify** - Transform ideas into structured specifications
3. **❓ Clarify** - (Optional) Resolve specification ambiguities interactively
4. **🏗️ Plan** - Generate detailed technical implementation plan
5. **📝 Tasks** - Break down into 25 dependency-organized implementation tasks
6. **✅ Checklists** - Generate quality assurance checklists
7. **📊 Analyze** - (Optional) Ensure consistency between all artifacts
8. **🚀 Implement** - Execute tasks in logical dependency order

### Getting Started

**For Beginners - Start Simple:**
```bash
# Learn the workflow
/sdd.help

# Your first project (1 hour)
/sdd.constitution "Simple, no dependencies, fast loading"
/sdd.specify "Create a simple landing page with contact form"
/sdd.plan "HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript"
/sdd.tasks
```

**For Intermediate Projects:**
```bash
# Professional portfolio website (2-4 weeks)
/sdd.constitution "Professional presentation, SEO optimized, mobile-first"
/sdd.specify "Build a portfolio showcasing React and Node.js projects"
/sdd.plan "Modern web technologies, static hosting, performance optimized"
/sdd.tasks
/sdd.implement
```

**For Advanced Team Projects:**
```bash
# Enterprise kanban system (6-8 weeks)
/sdd.constitution "Real-time collaboration, enterprise security, scalability"
/sdd.specify "Build collaborative kanban system with team features"
/sdd.plan "React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Socket.IO"
/sdd.tasks
/sdd.implement
```

### Best Practices

- Start with simple projects
- Every feature follows the SDD workflow
- Use `.clarify` for ambiguous specifications
- Share specifications before implementation
