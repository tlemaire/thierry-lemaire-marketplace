## How to Use These Samples

### 1. Learn SDD Capabilities
These samples demonstrate the comprehensive output you get from each SDD command:
- **Constitution**: Project principles and standards
- **Specification**: Detailed requirements with user stories
- **Plan**: Technical architecture and implementation strategy
- **Tasks**: Step-by-step implementation roadmap

### 2. Customize for Your Project
Use these samples as templates:
```bash
# Create your own constitution
/sdd.constitution "Your project principles and technology choices"

# Generate specification for your feature
/sdd.specify "Your feature description"

# Plan your technical implementation
/sdd.plan "Your technology stack"

# Get your task breakdown
/sdd.tasks
```

### 3. Understand Expected Outputs
Each sample shows the level of detail and quality you can expect:
- **Structured Content**: Clear organization with sections and subsections
- **Practical Examples**: Real code snippets and configurations
- **Complete Coverage**: From requirements through deployment
- **Actionable Items**: Specific files to create and tasks to complete

## Key Features Demonstrated

## SDD Workflow in Action

These samples represent a complete SDD workflow for building a user authentication system:

1. **Constitution**: Set project principles with KISS/YAGNI guidelines
2. **Specification**: Define authentication requirements with user stories
3. **Plan**: Design technical architecture with React/Node.js stack
4. **Tasks**: Break down into 25 manageable implementation steps
5. **Environment**: Generate .env.example and Makefile for productivity

The result is a production-ready foundation that any development team can immediately start implementing with clear direction and all necessary tools in place.
