- **Perfect For**: Teams, enterprise applications, complex systems

## What You'll Build
A professional kanban project management system featuring:

### Core Features
- **Multi-Board Support**: Create and manage multiple project boards
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Smooth card movement between columns
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Live updates, presence indicators
- **User Management**: Team invitations, role-based permissions
- **Search & Filtering**: Advanced filtering with saved searches

### Advanced Features
- **Rich Card Details**: Checklists, attachments, comments, mentions
- **Workflow Automation**: Custom column templates and automation rules
- **File Management**: Upload, preview, and organize attachments
- **Notifications**: Real-time alerts for mentions and assignments
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly PWA with offline support

### Enterprise Features
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Project and team performance metrics
- **Board Templates**: Pre-built Scrum and Kanban templates
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication and data protection
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ concurrent users per board
- **Monitoring**: Performance tracking and error reporting

## Learning Objectives
This advanced sample demonstrates:
- Complex system architecture design
- Real-time application development
- Enterprise security implementation
- Scalability planning
- Team collaboration features
- Mobile PWA development

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Redux Toolkit
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for live collaboration
- **Authentication**: JWT + OAuth integration
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar
- **Deployment**: Docker containers + Kubernetes

## Development Phases
1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-2): Setup, auth, database, real-time infrastructure
2. **Core Kanban** (Weeks 2-4): Boards, cards, drag-and-drop, collaboration
3. **Advanced Features** (Weeks 4-5): Search, notifications, automation
4. **Polish & Optimization** (Weeks 5-6): Mobile, performance, security, deployment
