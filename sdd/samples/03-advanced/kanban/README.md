# Kanban Board Sample - Advanced Level

This advanced SDD example demonstrates building a comprehensive collaborative kanban system with real-time features, team management, and enterprise-grade architecture.

## SDD Commands Used
```bash
/sdd.constitution "Real-time collaboration, enterprise security, scalability"
/sdd.specify "Collaborative Kanban system with real-time features"
/sdd.plan "React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Socket.IO, Docker"
/sdd.tasks
```

## Generated Files
- **[SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md)** - Enterprise-level specification with detailed requirements
- **[TASKS.md](TASKS.md)** - 25 detailed implementation tasks across 4 phases (250+ hours)

## Key Characteristics
- **Complexity**: Advanced
- **Time Estimate**: 6-8 weeks
- **Technology**: Full-stack (React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Socket.IO)
- **Dependencies**: Comprehensive (auth, storage, email services)
- **Perfect For**: Teams, enterprise applications, complex systems

## What You'll Build
A professional kanban project management system featuring:

### Core Features
- **Multi-Board Support**: Create and manage multiple project boards
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Smooth card movement between columns
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Live updates, presence indicators
- **User Management**: Team invitations, role-based permissions
- **Search & Filtering**: Advanced filtering with saved searches

### Advanced Features
- **Rich Card Details**: Checklists, attachments, comments, mentions
- **Workflow Automation**: Custom column templates and automation rules
- **File Management**: Upload, preview, and organize attachments
- **Notifications**: Real-time alerts for mentions and assignments
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly PWA with offline support

### Enterprise Features
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Project and team performance metrics
- **Board Templates**: Pre-built Scrum and Kanban templates
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication and data protection
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ concurrent users per board
- **Monitoring**: Performance tracking and error reporting

## Learning Objectives
This advanced sample demonstrates:
- Complex system architecture design
- Real-time application development
- Enterprise security implementation
- Scalability planning
- Team collaboration features
- Mobile PWA development

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Redux Toolkit
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for live collaboration
- **Authentication**: JWT + OAuth integration
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar
- **Deployment**: Docker containers + Kubernetes

## Development Phases
1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-2): Setup, auth, database, real-time infrastructure
2. **Core Kanban** (Weeks 2-4): Boards, cards, drag-and-drop, collaboration
3. **Advanced Features** (Weeks 4-5): Search, notifications, automation
4. **Polish & Optimization** (Weeks 5-6): Mobile, performance, security, deployment

This is the most comprehensive SDD example, showcasing how the methodology scales to complex, enterprise-level applications with real-time collaboration features and professional-grade architecture.

Perfect for developers wanting to understand how SDD handles large-scale projects with multiple developers, complex requirements, and enterprise needs.
