- Performance, security, and deployment requirements
- Environment management and development workflow standards

### 🔐 [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md)
**Generated by**: `/sdd.specify "Create a user authentication system with email verification, password reset, and social login"`
**Contains**:
- 4 detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Edge cases, constraints, and dependencies
- Success metrics and compliance requirements

### 🏗️ [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
**Generated by**: `/sdd.plan "React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, SendGrid"`
**Contains**:
- Complete technical architecture overview
- Database schema with 3 normalized tables
- 12 API endpoints with TypeScript interfaces
- 5 implementation phases with timeline
- Security and performance considerations

### 📝 [TASK_LIST.md](TASK_LIST.md)
**Generated by**: `/sdd.tasks`
**Contains**:
- 25 dependency-organized implementation tasks
- 5 development phases (Foundation → API → Social → Integration → Polish)
- Detailed acceptance criteria and testing requirements
- Estimated time allocations (total 140+ hours)
- File creation and modification lists

### ⚙️ [.env.example](.env.example)
**Generated by**: `/sdd.plan` (environment configuration section)
**Contains**:
- 40+ environment variables for complete setup
- Database, authentication, and external service configurations
- Feature flags and security settings
- Frontend build and development configurations

### 🔧 [Makefile](Makefile)
**Generated by**: `/sdd.plan` (development workflow section)
**Contains**:
- 25+ make commands for development workflow
- Automated environment setup and validation
- Database management (setup, migrate, seed, reset)
- Docker integration and deployment automation
- Code quality, testing, and performance tools

## How to Use These Samples

### 1. Learn SDD Capabilities
These samples demonstrate the comprehensive output you get from each SDD command:
- **Constitution**: Project principles and standards
- **Specification**: Detailed requirements with user stories
- **Plan**: Technical architecture and implementation strategy
- **Tasks**: Step-by-step implementation roadmap

### 2. Customize for Your Project
Use these samples as templates:
```bash
# Create your own constitution
/sdd.constitution "Your project principles and technology choices"

# Generate specification for your feature
/sdd.specify "Your feature description"

# Plan your technical implementation
/sdd.plan "Your technology stack"

# Get your task breakdown
/sdd.tasks
```

### 3. Understand Expected Outputs
Each sample shows the level of detail and quality you can expect:
- **Structured Content**: Clear organization with sections and subsections
- **Practical Examples**: Real code snippets and configurations
- **Complete Coverage**: From requirements through deployment
- **Actionable Items**: Specific files to create and tasks to complete

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 🎯 **Specification-First Approach**

### 🏗️ **Technical Planning**
- Database schema design with relationships
- API design with TypeScript interfaces
- Component structure and architecture decisions
- Environment and deployment configuration

### 📋 **Task Organization**
- 25 comprehensive implementation tasks
- Dependency-based ordering
- Time estimates and acceptance criteria
- Testing requirements for each task

### 🔧 **Development Automation**
- Complete Makefile with 25+ commands
- Environment variable templates
- Docker integration and deployment scripts
- Code quality and testing automation

### 🏛️ **Quality Standards**
- KISS and YAGNI principles embedded
- Security best practices
- Performance requirements and monitoring
- Comprehensive testing strategy

## SDD Workflow in Action

These samples represent a complete SDD workflow for building a user authentication system:

1. **Constitution**: Set project principles with KISS/YAGNI guidelines
2. **Specification**: Define authentication requirements with user stories
3. **Plan**: Design technical architecture with React/Node.js stack
4. **Tasks**: Break down into 25 manageable implementation steps
5. **Environment**: Generate .env.example and Makefile for productivity

The result is a production-ready foundation that any development team can immediately start implementing with clear direction and all necessary tools in place.
