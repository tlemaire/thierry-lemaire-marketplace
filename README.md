- `/sdd.constitution` - Define project principles with KISS and YAGNI guidelines
- `/sdd.specify` - Create structured specification from natural language
- `/sdd.clarify` - Resolve specification ambiguities interactively
- `/sdd.plan` - Generate technical implementation plan with environment setup
- `/sdd.tasks` - Create 25 dependency-organized implementation tasks
- `/sdd.checklist` - Generate quality checklists (requirements, UX, performance, accessibility)
- `/sdd.analyze` - Analyze consistency between spec, plan, and constitution
- `/sdd.implement` - Execute implementation tasks in dependency order

## Quick Start

### For Your Project:
```bash
# Start a new project with SDD
/sdd.constitution "Follow KISS principles, use React, TypeScript, Node.js"
/sdd.specify "Add user authentication with login and registration"
/sdd.plan "React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL"
/sdd.tasks
/sdd.implement
```

### Based on Project Complexity:
```bash
# Simple project (Hello World level)
/sdd.constitution "Simple, no dependencies, fast loading"
/sdd.specify "Create a landing page for my project"

# Professional project (Portfolio level)
/sdd.constitution "Professional presentation, SEO optimized, mobile-first"
/sdd.specify "Build a portfolio showcasing my React and Node.js projects"

# Team project (Kanban level)
/sdd.constitution "Real-time collaboration, enterprise security, scalability"
/sdd.specify "Build a collaborative project management tool with Kanban board"
```

## Key Principles

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):**
- Choose simple over complex solutions
- Use built-in language features before adding libraries
- Write straightforward code that's easy to understand

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):**
- Don't over-engineer solutions
- Don't add complexity for future problems
- Build only what you need right now

## Benefits

- **🎯 Clear Requirements**: Structured specifications eliminate ambiguity
- **⚡ Rapid Development**: Automated task generation and environment setup
- **🔧 Standardized Workflow**: Consistent process across all features
- **📋 Quality Assurance**: Built-in checklists and consistency analysis
- **🔄 Traceability**: Direct links from requirements to implementation
- **🛠️ Developer Friendly**: Makefile and .env templates for immediate productivity

## Usage

After installation, you can use any SDD command by typing `/sdd.<command>` in Claude Code.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Define project principles
/sdd.constitution "Prioritize simplicity, use React+TypeScript, maintain 90% test coverage"

# 2. Create feature specification
/sdd.specify "Build a task management system with drag-and-drop functionality"

# 3. Plan technical implementation
/sdd.plan "React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Docker"

# 4. Generate implementation tasks
/sdd.tasks
